1
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,400
Greetings, my friend. We are
all interested in the future,

2
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,000
for that is where you and I
are going to spend the
rest of our lives.

3
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,900
And remember my friend, future
events such as these will affect
you in the future.

4
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,200
You are interested in the
unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable.

5
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,400
That is why you are here.
And now, for the first time,

6
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,400
we are bringing to you the full story of what
happened on that fateful day.

7
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,900
We are giving you all the evidence, based
only on the secret testimonies

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,600
of the miserable souls who survived

9
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,700
this terrifying ordeal. The
incidents, the places,

10
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:13,700
my friend we cannot keep this a secret any longer.
Let us punish the guilty,

11
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:19,200
let us reward the innocent. My friend,

12
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,400
can your heart stand the shocking facts
about grave robbers

13
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
from outer space?

14
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,100
Plan 9 From Outer Space

15
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,100
All of us on this earth, know that
there is a time to live,

16
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,600
and that there is a time to die,
yet death is always a shock

17
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,500
to those left behind.

18
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,500
It is even more of a shock,when death,
the proud brother, comes suddenly without warning.

19
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,200
Just at sundown, a small group,

20
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,200
gathered in silent prayer around
the newly-opened grave

21
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,400
of the beloved wife of an elderly man.
Sundown of the day,

22
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,600
yet also the sundown of the old man's heart,

23
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,100
for the shadows of grief clouded his very reason.

24
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
The funeral over, the saddened group left the graveside.

25
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,200
It was when the gravediggers started their task

26
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,300
that strange things began to take place.

27
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,400
Fifteen to four.

28
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,300
Yup, right on schedule. There's the
ol' San Fernando Valley

29
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,900
out there now.
-You better radio in

30
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,400
for landing instructions, Danny.
-Right, Jeff.

31
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Burbank Tower, this is American
Flight 812, over.

32
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Wouldn't surprise
me any if  he's asleep this time of the morning.

33
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,900
American Flight 812, this is Burbank Tower.
If I were asleep

34
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
you'd never get on the ground !
Your case maybe you'd be up there for good. Over.

35
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,200
You got me that time, Mac.
This American Flight 812 requesting -

36
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,700
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, over.

37
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, over.

38
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,800
Holy mackeral.
-Burbank Tower to American Flight 812,

39
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,500
are you in trouble?

40
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,800
-Trouble ?
-Take a look for yourself.

41
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,500
-What in the world...
-That's nothing from this world.

42
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812,
are you in trouble? Are you in trouble?

43
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,700
-Mayday, mayday. Stand by, Burbank Tower.
-Do you suppose the passengers saw it?

44
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,500
I doubt it. Most of them are asleep.
But it was quite a jolt, Jeff. I'll check.

45
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,900
Good. We'll get them ready for landing.
Keep it quiet until we get instructions.

46
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
-Right.
-American Flight 812 reporting to Burbank Tower, over.

47
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,200
-D'you hear anything ?
-I thought I did.

48
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,500
Don't like hearin' noises.
'Specially when there ain't s'posed to be any.

49
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,100
-Yeah, sorta spooky-like.

50
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,500
-Maybe we're getting' old.
-Whatever it is it's gone now.

51
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,100
-That's the best thing for us too. Gone.

52
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,200
-Yeah, let's go.

53
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,800
The grief of his wife's death

54
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,900
became greater and greater agony.

55
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,800
The home they had so long shared together,
became a tomb.

56
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,300
A sweet memory of her joyous living.

57
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,900
The sky to which she had once looked,
was now only a covering for her dead body.

58
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,200
The ever-beautiful flowers she had
planted with her own hand,

59
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,500
became nothing more than the
lost roses of her cheeks.

60
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Confused by his great loss, the old man

61
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,300
left that home,
never to return again.

62
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,700
At the funeral of the old man,
unknown to his mourners,

63
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,900
his dead wife was watching.

64
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,500
-First his wife, then he.
-Tragic.

65
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,900
-Tell me something. Why was his wife buried in the ground,
and

66
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,800
he sealed in a crypt?
-Something to do with family tradition.

67
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,000
A superstition of some sort.

68
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,100
Well, it's getting' dark. We'd best be on our way.

69
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,500
Then, as two of his mourners left his final resting place.

70
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,700
Minutes later, the police, lead by Inspector Daniel Clay,

71
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,900
arrived at the scene.

72
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,100
-Who found him ?
-The man and girl.

73
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,200
-Medical, uh, examiner been 'round yet?
-Just left.

74
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,300
The morgue wagon oughta be along most any time.
-You get their

75
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,400
statement ?
Yeah, much as we could. They're pretty scared.

76
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
-Finding a mess like this oughta make anyone frightened.

77
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,300
Have one of the boys take the guy
and the girl back to town. You take charge.

78
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,200
-Okay Inspector. What're you gonna do?

79
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,700
-Look around a little.
-Pretty dark out there.

80
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,900
Once you get beyond those lights you won't be
able to see your hand in front of your face.

81
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
-I will get one of the flashlights from the patrol car.

82
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,100
-You be careful Clay.
-I'm a big boy now, Johnny.

83
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,300
Looks like a bobcat tore through them.

84
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Yeah.

85
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,700
Say Lieutenant,

86
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,800
d'you get that funny odour ?
-How could I miss it ?

87
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,300
Oh, that'll be the morgue wagon now.

88
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,100
-That's the fifth siren in the last hour.
-Oh, something's happened down at

89
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,200
the cemetery. A lot of police cars and lights.
I stopped but I didn't see anything.

90
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,100
Oh well, whatever it is, the morning paper
will carry the whole story.

91
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,800
You seem to still be up there somewhere.

92
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,200
Maybe I am.

93
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,300
I don't think I've ever seen you
in this mood before.

94
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I guess it's because I've never been
in this mood before.

95
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,700
Something about your flight ?

96
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,600
Yeah.

97
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,700
What happened, Jeff ?

98
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,200
-I saw a flying saucer.
-A saucer ?

99
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,300
You mean the kind from up there ?
-Yeah, or its counterpart.

100
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,400
I was shaped like a huge cigar.
Dan [something] saw it too.

101
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,500
When it passed over, the whole compartment
lighted up with a blinding glare.

102
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,800
Then there was a tremendous wind that practically
knocked us off our course.

103
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,900
-Well did you report it ?
-Yeah, radioed in immediately and they said well

104
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
keep it quiet until you land.
Then as soon as we landed, big army brass grabbed us

105
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,200
and made us swear to
secrecy about the whole thing.

106
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,300
Oh, it burns me up. These things have been seen for years.
They're here, it's a fact.

107
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,200
And the public oughta know about it.
-There must be something more you can do about it.

108
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,300
Oh no there isn't.
Oh, but what's the point of making a fuss.

109
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Last night I saw a flying object that
couldn't possibly have been from this planet.

110
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,700
But I can't say a word. I'm muzzled by army brass!
I can't even admit I saw the thing!

111
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Sounds like Clay's in trouble.

112
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,300
Bet that apparition we saw had
something to do with it.

113
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
Come on.

114
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,900
-Is he dead ?
-Yeah.

115
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,200
He's messed up as bad as those two back there.

116
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,800
S'pose that saucer or whatever it was
had something to do with this?

117
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,800
Your guess is as good as mine, Larry.

118
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,600
But one thing's sure. Inspector Clay is dead...

119
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,700
murdered...and somebody's responsible!

120
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
You're in charge now, Lieutenant.

121
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,400
-Yeah, guess I am. Kelton.
-Yes Sir ?

122
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Get back up to the car and get on the radio.
Tell the coroner he's gotta make another trip out here.

123
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,500
Well how 'bout the lab boys ?

124
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Well who do you think we left back at the car,
boy scouts ? Come on, Larry.

125
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Greater love hath no man, than to
lay down his life for another.

126
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,900
It is always difficult to have last words

127
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
over the grave of a friend.
And Inspector Daniel Clay was a friend.

128
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,700
A dear friend to me and to all of us.

129
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,300
The bell has rung upon his great career.

130
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:17,900
Now we lay him to rest. A rest well deserved, but so premature.

131
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,000
People turning south from the freeway
were startled when they saw

132
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,100
flying saucers high over Hollywood Boulevard.

133
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,100
A woman, startled by the sight in the
sky, telephones the police.

134
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,700
There comes a time in each man's life,

135
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,800
when he can't even believe his own eyes.

136
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,300
Saucers seen over Hollywood!

137
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,700
Flying saucers seen over Washington D.C.

138
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,600
The army convoy moved into the field.

139
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,900
Rockets were quickly set up.

140
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,600
Colonel Tom Edwards, in charge of saucer field activities,

141
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,800
was to make the greatest decision of his career.

142
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,900
He made that decision. Colonel Edwards gave the signal to fire.

143
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,700
Then as swiftly as they had come,
they were gone.

144
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Even to the piercing eye of radar and the speeding jet fighters.

145
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,200
-Quite a sight, wasn't it Sir.
-A sight I'd rather not be seeing.

146
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,200
-Are you worried about them Sir ?

147
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,200
Well, they must have a reason for their visits.

148
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:49,300
Visits? Well that would indicate visitors!
Are big guns the usual way of welcoming visitors?

149
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,400
We haven't always fired at them.

150
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,500
For a time we tried to contact them by radio, but no response.

151
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:03,800
Then they attacked a town. A small town, I'll admit.
But nevertheless a town of people.

152
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,100
People who died.
-I never heard about that Sir.

153
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Well, it was covered up by the higher echelon. Take any fire,

154
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,000
any earthquake, any major disaster,

155
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,100
then wonder.
Flying saucers, Captain,

156
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,700
are still a rumour.

157
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,300
Officially.

158
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,200
Looks like we beat them off again Sir.

159
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,300
What do they want...where are they from...where are they going...

160
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,600
They, Sir ? Who ?

161
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,000
Oh, this is a training manoeuver, Sir.
We only did a little practice firing at the clouds.

162
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,300
Yeah. I wonder what their next move will be.

163
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,900
What will their next move be ?

164
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,200
Your space commander has returned from Earth.

165
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,300
Send him in.

166
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,900
You have your report ?

167
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,800
We had to pull in here to
Space Station 7 for regeneration.

168
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,900
We're returning to the planet Earth
immediately thereafter.

169
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,700
-What progress has been made ?
-We contacted government officials.

170
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,500
They refuse over existence.

171
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,400
What plan will you follow now ?

172
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Plan 9. It's been absolutely impossible to work through these Earth creatures.

173
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,300
Their soul is too controlled.

174
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Plan 9...ah yes. Plan 9 deals

175
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,300
with the resurrection of the dead.

176
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,400
Long-distance electrodes shot into the pinion
pituitary glands of recent dead.

177
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,600
Have you attempted any of this plan as yet ?
-Yes Excellency.

178
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,100
How successful has it been ?

179
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,200
We have risen two so far.
We shall be just as successful on more.

180
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,200
The living...they have no suspicion of your movements ?

181
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
We had to dispose of one policeman.

182
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,900
However, none of those risen have been seen.
At least, not by anyone who still remains alive.

183
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,100
It's too bad it must be handled this way. However it must.

184
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,600
Those who take from the grave will lead the way for our other operations.

185
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,500
Yes, Excellency.
-Continue on. Report to me

186
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
in two Earth days.

187
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,800
I feared His Excellency wouldn't take our report this well.

188
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,200
Well had he been dealing with our own people
his reaction would have been completely different.

189
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,500
He understands the difficulties of the Earth race.

190
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,600
What do you think will be the next obstacle
the Earth people will put in our way?

191
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,700
Well, as long as they can think we'll have our problems.

192
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,200
But those whom we're using cannot think. They are the dead.
Brought to a simulated life by our electrode guns.

193
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:10,000
You know, it's an interesting think when you consider...the Earth people, who can think,

194
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,100
are so frightened by those who cannot: the dead.

195
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,100
Well our ship should be regenerated. We better get started.

196
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,900
I still think you oughta go in town and stay with your mother until I get back.

197
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,900
This is our home and nothing's going to take me from it.

198
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Besides, most men try and keep their wives from going home to Momma.

199
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,300
-That's not the point.
-That's all the point there's going to be.

200
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,300
Now toddle off and fly your flying machine, Darling.
But if you see any more

201
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,100
flying saucers, will you tell them to pick another house to buzz?

202
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,300
Don't worry about me.

203
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,300
Oh you're the only thing I do worry about. Oh forget about the flying saucers.

204
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:53,900
They're up there. But there's something in that cemetery,

205
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,100
and that's too close for comfort.

206
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,000
The saucers are up there. And the cemetery's out there.

207
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:07,700
But I'll be locked up in there. Now off to your wild blue yonders.

208
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,000
You promise you'll lock the doors immediately ?

209
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,000
I promise. Besides, I'll be in bed before half an hour is gone,

210
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,300
with your pillow beside me.
-My pillow ?

211
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Well, I have to have something to keep me company while you're away.

212
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:30,500
Sometimes in the night when it does get a little lonely,
I reach over and touch it, then it doesn't seem so lonely anymore.

213
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,700
A crazy kid.

214
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,600
I do love you, Darlin'.

215
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,800
See you Thursday.
-Goodbye, Honey.

216
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,600
You know I'm not leaving here until you're locked safely inside.

217
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,700
All right, Darling.

218
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,100
If you're especially nice I may even lock the side door.

219
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,600
And be sure you keep the yard lights on.

220
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,800
You're mighty silent this trip, Jeff.

221
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,800
You haven't spoken ten words since takeoff.

222
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,000
I guess I'm preoccupied, Danny.

223
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,100
We've got thirty-three passengers back there that have time to be preoccupied.

224
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,600
Flying this flybird doesn't give you that opportunity.

225
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,700
I guess you're right, Danny.

226
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,900
-Paula ?
-Yeah.

227
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,100
-There's nothing wrong between you two ?
-Oh no, nothing like that.

228
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,700
Just that I'm worried, she being there alone and those strange things flying over the house and

229
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,200
those incidents in the graveyard the past few days. It's just got me worried.

230
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,600
the police have figured out that cemetery thing by now.

231
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,000
-I hope so.
-If you're really that worried Jeff why don't you radio in and find out?

232
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Mac should be on duty at the field by now.
He could call Paula and relay the message to you.

233
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,800
-Hi Edith.
-Hi Silents. I haven't heard a word from this end of the plane since we left the field.

234
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,300
Jeff's been giving me and himself a study in silence.

235
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,500
-You boys are feudin'?
-Oh no Edie, nothing like that.

236
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,200
Hey Edie, how about you and me balling [bawling?] it up in Albuquerque ?

237
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,800
Albuquerque ? Have you read that flight schedule Boy ?
-What about it ?

238
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,900
We land in Albuquerque at 4 am. That's strictly a nine o'clock town.

239
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,300
Well I know a friend that'll help us --

240
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,700
-Let's have a problem first, huh Danny. [?]
-Ah he's worried about Paula.

241
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,800
I read about that cemetery business.
I tried to get you kids to not buy too near one of those things.

242
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,400
He thought it'd be quiet and peaceful there.

243
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,900
No doubt about that.
It's quiet alright, like a tomb.

244
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,300
I'm sorry Jeff, that was a bad joke.

245
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,800
Say., I almost forgot what I came in here for.
How's the coffee situation?

246
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,900
-Mmmm that's for me.
-That sure wouldn't hurt anything, Edie.

247
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Okay, I'll be right back. And say Jeff, make that call to your wife.

248
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Huh, not only will she throw water on my Albuquerque plan but now she's
repeating herself.

249
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,700
-How 'bout that Albuquerque ball ?
-I can't resist your charm, Danny Boy.

250
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:55,900
Residents near the cemetery paid little attention to the blast of thunder

251
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,600
and the flash of lightning.

252
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,500
But from the blast, arose the moving figure of the dead old man.

253
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,900
Hello ? Who ?

254
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Mac ? Well, hi Mac !

255
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,300
Sure I'm all right.

256
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
I just fell asleep.

257
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,900
Tell Jeff I'm all right.

258
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Okay Mac. Thanks for calling. Goodnight.

259
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Mrs. Trent ! Mrs. Trent ! What's wrong ?

260
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,700
They'll be at the hatch in a moment.
You can open it now, Tanna.

261
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,800
Turn off the electrodes quickly.
They can't tell us from anyone else.

262
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,500
It's tough to find something when you don't know what you're looking for.

263
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,600
-I don't think the Lieutenant does either.
-Then what're doing out here? I was off duty an hour ago.

264
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Ah don't ask me any questions. I'm just a hardhand [hat? head?] just like you.

265
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,900
What do you suppose that noise was?

266
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,800
Whatever it was it's no more strange than the other things happening around this cemetery.

267
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,200
Spirits like Old Farmer Caulder talked about.

268
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:02,300
-Heh. Maybe.
-The only spirits he saw tonight were those I smelled on his breath.

269
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,200
Well don't forget Mrs. Trent claims to have seen them too.
She didn't have anything on her breath.

270
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,300
-She was hysterical.
-Well true, she was frightened, and in a state of shock.

271
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,800
But, don't forget that torn nightgown and the scratched feet.

272
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:22,300
Yeah I hadn't thought of that.
I guess that's why you're a detective lieutenant

273
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,900
and I'm still a uniformed cop.

274
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,300
Sometimes it's only the breaks, Larry. In the meantime let's get-

275
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,200
-Lieutenant, Lieutenant ! Did you hear that ?
-How could we help it ?

276
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,100
-It sure was strange.
-Know what it was ?

277
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,500
-No more than you do.
-If it weren't for orders I'd get out of here right now.

278
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,900
-It was a saucer.
-A flying saucer ? What makes you say that ?

279
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,500
You remember the noise we heard the other night ?

280
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,000
We were knocked to the ground, how could I forget ?

281
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,800
Exactly, but you're not remembering that sound.

282
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,900
There you're wrong, Lieutenant.
I'm with a fact the sound is similar, but what about the blinding light?

283
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,500
Well haven't you heard ?
Many times a saucer hasn't had a glow,

284
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:01,100
or a light of any kind for that matter.
-That proves it. What next Lietenant ?

285
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:07,800
Maybe this doesn't mean much,
but uh Jamie and me found a grave that looks like it's been busting into.

286
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,300
-What ? Where ?
-Why uh why...

287
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,800
-Come on man out with it, we haven't got all day to waste.

288
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,900
-Uh, just over there beyond the crypt.
-All right, show us the way !

289
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,800
Look, here it is Lieutenant.

290
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,900
Ah it's been broken into all right.

291
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Strange. If someone had broken in, the dirt should be piled up here somewhere.

292
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,900
It looks like it's fallen in into the grave.
-Larry you'll be out of that uniform before you know it.

293
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,000
-Do we have the right to look down there Lieutenant ?
-Ah, technically no.

294
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:48,900
Well, this spot looks familiar, though.
We shouldn't investigate any further without the permission of  next of kin.

295
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,600
Let's go get it !

296
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,700
-How ?
-I see what you mean, the gravestone's down there.

297
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,400
Well, let's go down and find out who's grave it is.

298
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,200
-How ?
-By going down and finding out !

299
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,300
-Are you sure you mean that Lieutenant ?
-If I didn't mean it I wouldn't have said it.

300
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,400
-Scared ?
-Well, why do I always get hooked up with these spook details?

301
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,300
Monsters, graves, bodies,...

302
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,400
oooh all right.

303
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,000
Casket's here, but nobody's in it.

304
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,800
Can you read the name on the casket?

305
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,100
It's too dark. Give me a flashlight.

306
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,200
-How 'bout a match ?
-We sure could try it. Let me have them !

307
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,300
It's Inspector Clay's grave !
Be he ain't in it!

308
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,200
But meanwhile, in the Pentagon, in Washington DC...

309
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,700
Try G2...

310
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,300
...come in !

311
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,400
Yes of course, I'll keep in touch.

312
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:25,700
Come in, Colonel Edwards. Close the door. At ease, Colonel.

313
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,500
-Thank you, Sir.
-Sit down.

314
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,000
I understand, Colonel, you've been on tap for many of our saucer attacks.

315
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,500
I'm in charge of field operations, Sir.

316
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,600
You believe there are such things as flying saucers, Colonel ?

317
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,000
-Yessir.
-You've seen them ?

318
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,800
Yessir.

319
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:54,500
You realize there's a government directive
stating that there is no such thing as a flying saucer?

320
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,400
Yessir.

321
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,700
Do you stand by your statement that you've seen flying saucers ?

322
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,100
Well, uh...

323
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,900
yessir.

324
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
This could mean a court marshall. Admitting this against direct orders.

325
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,400
General Roberts, may I speak freely ?

326
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,400
-You may.
How could I hope to hold down my command

327
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,500
if I didn't believe in what I saw and shot at?

328
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,500
-I, uh, like you Colonel.
-Thank you, Sir.

329
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,300
There are flying saucers.

330
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,600
There's no doubt they are in our skies.
They've been there for some time.

331
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,200
What're we going to do about them ?

332
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,900
-Who knows ?
-Then, uh, they really are there ?

333
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
-I thought you were convinced of that !
-I am.

334
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,300
We've had contact with them.

335
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,200
-Contact ? How ?
-Radio.

336
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,300
-They speak our language ?
-Well not quite.

337
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,700
We  received messages from their space ships.
For a while it came in as just a lot of jumbled noise.

338
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,500
And now, Sir ?

339
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:10,500
Well since they first uh tried contact with us by radio,
we've developed a language computer.

340
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,300
A machine that breaks down any language to our own.

341
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,400
General, uh,  what's this all got to do with me?

342
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:23,800
Well you've been in charge of saucer field activity for a long while.

343
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,700
I think it's about time you heard these recordings. Do you mind?

344
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,800
Mind ? Huh, I'm anxious !

345
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
This is Eros, a space soldier from a planet of your galaxy.

346
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:48,300
I fully realize our language differences,
however I also know you finally have

347
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:56,400
perfected the dictorobitary, or as you on Earth put it,
the language computer. So you can now understand that which I speak.

348
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,600
Since the beginning of your time, we have been far beyond your planet.

349
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:07,900
It has taken you centuries to even grasp what we developed eons of your years ago.

350
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,300
Do you still believe it impossible we exist?
You didn't actually think you were the only inhabited planet in the universe?

351
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,900
How can any race be so stupid ?

352
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,800
Permit me to set your mind at ease.
We do not want to conquer your planet. Only save it.

353
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,800
We could have destroyed it long ago, if that had been our aim.

354
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:36,300
Our principal purpose is friendly.
I admit, we have had to take certain means which you might

355
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,500
refer to as criminal,

356
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,600
but that is because of your big guns
which have destroyed some of our representatives.

357
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:50,400
If you persist in denying us our landings,
then we must only accept that you do not want us on friendly terms.

358
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,900
We then have no alternative but to destroy you before you destroy us.

359
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:05,600
With your ancient, juvenile minds, you have developed explosives too fast for your minds to conceive what you were doing.

360
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,900
You are on the verge of destroying the entire universe.

361
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,100
We are part of that universe.

362
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,200
This is our last -

363
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:23,700
That's the end of that one.
Atmospheric conditions in outer space often interfere with transmitting.

364
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,800
How many of these recordings do you have General ?

365
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,900
An even dozen up to now. This was the last one.
We received it over a month ago.

366
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,200
-Do you think they mean business ?
-We can't afford to take any chances.

367
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,000
Come over here. You ever been to Hollywood ?

368
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,900
-Oh a couple of times. A few years ago.
-You're going to be there in the morning.

369
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,900
Just a few minutes from Hollywood, in the town of San Fernando, reports have come in

370
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
of saucers flying so low the exhaust  knocked people to the ground.

371
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,800
There have even been stated claims of saucer landings.

372
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,900
Major Carlson will replace you while you're out there.

373
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,200
You're the best man for the job of attempting to contact them.

374
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,000
Find them, Colonel. See what in hell it is they want!

375
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,100
All right, Sir.

376
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,500
These are confidential reports, Colonel.
Read them over carefully on the plane,

377
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:26,600
turn them over to intelligence when you get to Los Angeles.
They'll have further orders for disposition.

378
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,400
Yessir.

379
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,500
-Colonel Edwards ?
-Yessir ?

380
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,600
-Good luck.
-Thank you, Sir.

381
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,500
We are ready to report, Excellency.

382
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,500
-You are many days late.
-It was unavoidable.

383
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,600
We tried to transmit via televisor, but atmospheric
conditions made transmission impossible.

384
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,600
-You should have transmitted as soon as conditions permitted.
-I thought time was of the essence.

385
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,400
Suspicion  has fallen upon our movements.
Our ships have been viewed near the point of operations.

386
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,500
And what has this extra time gained, Eros?

387
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,500
We have successfully risen three of the dead ones.

388
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,600
-Permit me to see one.
-Bring in the big one.

389
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,700
Use your small electrode gun.

390
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,800
I have taken two ships from your command.

391
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,300
But...that will leave only my ship !

392
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,300
It is necessary that you continue your mission alone.

393
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,200
I have need of your other ships elsewhere.

394
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:01,300
Even though you have risen three of the Earth dead,
the plan is far from successful,

395
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,600
and you Eros, must prove it an operational success before
more time,

396
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:11,600
energy, and ships, may be spent on it.

397
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,800
We will not fail. Everything is on our side.

398
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,200
Not everything !
You do not have the live Earth people !

399
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,600
You report that your ship was viewed at scene of your present operations ?

400
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,000
That is correct.

401
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
They have been viewed many times, but not at the scene of operations.

402
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,300
Something must be done about that.

403
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,500
Stop him Tanna ! He's close enough ! Turn off your electrode gun !

404
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:53,700
No ! No ! Stop him Tanna !

405
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,100
I can't get it, it's jammed !
-Stop him you fool !

406
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,200
Drop the gun to the floor, Tanna !
The metal will break contact!

407
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,100
[Gasping] That was too close !

408
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,200
Yes.

409
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,900
Bring the giant here that I may get a better look at him.

410
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,700
Yes, he's a fine specimen.
Are they all this powerful on planet Earth ?

411
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,800
This one is an exception, Excellency.

412
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,900
-What are the other two like ?
-One is a woman, the other an old man.

413
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,900
-An old man, you say ?
-Yes, Excellency.

414
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,500
This gives me a plan. Put the big one away.

415
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,600
Pick up your electrode gun.
Make sure it's in working order before pointing it at him.

416
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,700
Whatever made it jam must have been cleared by the fall.

417
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,000
Take him back to the ship.

418
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:24,300
The old one must be sacrificed. Re-land on Earth.
Send the old one to enter a dwelling.

419
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,500
Then cut off the electrokinetic and turn on your ship's decomposure ray.

420
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:39,600
The result will astound those watching. Astound them enough to delay their attention until you have gained your other recruits from the cemetery.

421
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,900
Yes, Excellency. It'll be done.

422
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Report to me when this has been accomplished.

423
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:58,300
Eros, the Earth people are getting to that which we fear.

424
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:02,100
Since they will not listen or respect our existence,

425
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,200
they cannot help but believe our powers when they see their own dead walking 'round again,

426
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:11,500
brought about by our advancement in such things. As soon as you have enough of the dead recruits,

427
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:21,000
march them on the capitals of the Earth, let nothing stand in your way. Their own dead will be used to make them accept our existence, and believe in that fact.

428
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:08,000
Mr. and Mrs. Trent...this is Colonel Edwards from Washington DC.

429
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,400
-Good evening, Colonel.
-Hello Colonel.

430
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,600
Colonel would like to ask you a few questions.

431
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,700
-Questions ? What about, Colonel ?
-May I, uh, sit down ?

432
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,500
Oh, I'm sorry, please do.

433
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,600
I want to ask you about your strange experience the other night, when you saw the flying saucer.

434
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,700
After that the police brought me home.

435
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,100
I hope I never see such a sight again.

436
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,500
Well after your description I don't think I'd want to see it either.

437
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,600
One thing
more...after you were forced to the ground by that blast of wind,

438
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:47,300
was it a hot or cold blast?
-It's kind of hard to explain.

439
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:53,500
It wasn't hot, wasn't cold, it was just a terrific force. We-we couldn't get off the ground.

440
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,700
The light blinded me so badly I couldn't see a thing.

441
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:03,300
We could only feel the pressure of the wind, until it was gone.
When the glare left us,

442
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,600
we could see a glowing ball disappearing off in the distance.

443
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,300
-Which way ?
-Toward the cemetery.

444
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,600
This is the most fantastic story I've ever heard.

445
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,500
And every word of it's true, too.

446
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,900
That's the fantastic part of it.

447
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
We found a lot of suspicious things out in that cemetery.

448
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:41,300
Then again, didn't find anything to base a fact or suspicion on.

449
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,800
Hey, do you hear anything.

450
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,100
You see anything out there Kelton ?

451
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,900
Too dark, Lieutenant.

452
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
But something's started stinking awful bad.

453
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:13,500
There's something out there.

454
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:44,900
-What do you make of that ?
-You got me ! It didn't look that way a minute ago.

455
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,400
-What about your man ?
-Oh, in the excitement I forgot all about Kelton.

456
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,900
Oh, he'll be all right in a few minutes.

457
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,700
-Did you see that thing ? Did you get it ?
-We got it.

458
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,600
What was it ? It didn't fall...I fired every bullet I had.

459
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:14,200
So did I. I don't know what it was or what happened, but unless that bag of bones

460
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:17,800
can reassemble itself, it's out of the running now.

461
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,500
Colonel I've been out here so often you'd think I'd taken a lease on this place.

462
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,500
Not a long lease, I hope.

463
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,600
I see what you mean. But you know, I can't help but feel the answer's out here
somewhere.

464
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,600
Is the uh girl safe ?

465
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,900
Mrs. Trent you'd better stay with the car.
-Stay here alone? Not on your life.

466
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,500
-Modern women...
-Yeah, they been that way all down through the ages.

467
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,200
Especially in a spot like this.

468
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,300
-Kelton ! -Yessir ?
-Stay with Mrs. Trent.

469
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,400
All right, Lieutenant.

470
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:01,100
-Now you stay close to the officer, Honey.
-I'd feel safer with you.

471
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:10,700
-Now the Lieutenant knows best.
-Oh I don't like it, but I guess there isn't much I can do about it.

472
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,800
-You have a gun ?
-No.

473
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:21,900
Know how to use one ?

474
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,900
After four years in the Marine Corps ?

475
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,600
-Here.
-You think we'll need these ?

476
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,500
You can never tell. Let's get going.

477
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,200
-What do you expect to find out here ?
-Well there's only one answer to that Mr. Trent,

478
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:00,700
we'll know when we find it. Inspector Clay's grave is right over here.

479
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:04,500
-Is that the one you told me was broken into ?
-Yes.

480
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,900
-This it ?
-Yeah.

481
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,600
Looks to me like someone had broken out instead of in.

482
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:33,600
-I figured that, but that's impossible ! -I wonder.
-Look, Colonel, some things just can't happen.

483
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:40,300
Yeah well after that apparition that was draped across Mr. Trent's patio, I would say we should keep our minds open to anything.

484
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,300
Look, Colonel, I'm a policeman. I've got to deal in facts.

485
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:52,000
But, I guess I'll have to go along with you.  You know I bet my badge right now we haven't seen the last of those weirdies.

486
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,800
-They'll discover our ship soon.
-You going to let them find us ?

487
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:04,900
It's the only way. These are the same men who have been so close so often.

488
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:08,100
They must be halted before they can inform others about us.

489
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,200
-But there were others in the car !
-They'll be taken too.

490
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:18,500
Send the big one to get the girl and the policeman. I'll turn on the dictorobitary so we may converse with them.

491
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,500
You know, maybe we're barking up the wrong tree.

492
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,500
One thing a policeman learns, Mr. Trent, is patience.

493
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,600
-Where the burn spot you mentioned.
-Right over the - look!

494
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,300
We'll investigate, but move carefully.

495
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:02,500
A moment or two more, and you will be the first live Earth people

496
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,700
ever to enter a celestial ship.

497
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:10,100
Wow...boy,  how could anything that big hide for so long a time ?

498
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,300
Never heard metal sound like that before.

499
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,400
-What do you see ?
-Only my reflection. Must be some kind of one-way glass.

500
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:24,100
-How do you get into this thing ?
-I'm not sure I want to find out.

501
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:37,700
They're just outside.

502
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,200
You can open the outer hatch now.

503
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
-You goin' in that thing ?
-That's what we're here for.

504
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:10,100
-I don't know, the way these things speed around we might just get in there and pft! Off it goes.
-That's a chance we take.

505
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:17,100
Well, I took a chance on those earlier airplanes. Might just as well see what the inside of one of these looks like. Got your guns ready ?

506
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:23,100
-I tell you one thing, if a little green man jumps out at me I'm shooting first and asking questions later.

507
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,800
They're in the outer chamber now.

508
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,800
Eros, do we have to kill them ?

509
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,200
-Yes.
-It seems such a waste.

510
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:50,800
Well wouldn't it be better to kill a few now than, with their meddling, permit
them  to destroy the entire universe ?

511
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,000
-You're always right, Eros.
-Of course.

512
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:00,100
But those are not my words, those are the words of the Ruler.

513
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:07,900
Now you two stay right where you're at.

514
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:20,900
We will do as you command. For the moment.
-No for the moment about it. You just do as I tell you.

515
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:32,500
You do not need guns.
-Maybe we think we do.

516
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,900
They would be of no use to you now.
-They've been mighty useful before on flesh and blood,

517
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:40,700
and you two look like you've got a lot of both.

518
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:48,200
True, they would be effective upon us. If you were to have the opportunity to use them...

519
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:53,500
Mister, if you don't get away from that control board I'll show you just how
effective they can be.

520
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,500
Shall we talk now, or wait ? Your friends will be here shortly.

521
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:05,100
-What friends ?
-Those you left at the vehicle.

522
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,000
-If you've done anything to Paula...
-Take it easy Mr. Trent.

523
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:13,100
Oh I assure you, no harm has come to her. Would you like to see?

524
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:19,600
Next time you try that I won't aim at the board.
-You're a headstrong young man.

525
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:23,200
I was only going to turn on the televisor so you could see her movements.

526
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:30,900
Go ahead, my friend, but move very carefully.

527
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,100
She's only fainted.

528
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:51,800
-You fiend !
-I ? A fiend ? ...

529
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,600
I am a soldier of our planet !

530
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:03,100
I ? A fiend ? We did not come here as enemies.

531
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,800
We came only with friendly intentions. To talk.

532
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,400
To ask your aid.

533
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,000
-Our aid ?
-Yes.

534
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:18,500
Your aid for the whole universe. But your governments of Earth refused even to accept our existence.

535
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:24,900
Even though you've seen us, heard our messages, you still refused to accept us.

536
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:29,400
Why is it so important that you want to contact the governments of our Earth ?

537
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:33,700
Because of death. Because all you of Earth are idiots !

538
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,700
-Now you just hold on, Buster.
-No you hold on.

539
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:43,500
First was your firecracker, a harmless explosive. Then your handgrenade.

540
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:51,200
They began to kill your own people a few at a time. Then the bomb, then a larger bomb.

541
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:56,100
Many people are killed at one time. Then your scientists

542
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:00,200
stumbled upon the atom bomb. Split the atom.

543
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:04,600
Then the hydrogen bomb, where you actually explode the air itself.

544
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:11,300
Now you [audio jump] brings the destruction of the entire universe, served by our sun.

545
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:17,200
The only explosion left is the solaronite.

546
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:21,100
-Why there's no such thing.
-Perhaps to you.

547
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:26,200
But we've known it for centuries. Your scientists will stumble upon it as they have all the others.

548
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:33,600
But the juvenile minds you possess will not comprehend its strength, until it's too late.

549
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,300
You're way above our heads.

550
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,400
The solaronite is a way to explode the actual particles of sunlight.

551
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,200
Why that's impossible.

552
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:48,300
Even now, your scientists are working on a way to harness the sun's rays.

553
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,500
The rays of sunlight are minute particles.

554
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:55,500
Is it so far from your imagination they cannot do as I have suggested?

555
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,800
Why a particle of sunlight can't even be seen or measured.

556
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:02,900
Can you see or measure an atom ? Yet you can explode one.

557
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:06,700
A ray of sunlight is made up many atoms.

558
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,800
So what if we do developed this solaronite bomb ? We'd be even a stronger nation than now.

559
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:17,300
Stronger. You see ? You see ? Your stupid minds...stupid ! Stupid !!

560
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,500
-That's all I'm taking from you !
-Get back here you jerk !

561
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:22,300
Let him finish.

562
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:33,500
It's because of men like you that all must be destroyed.

563
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:38,600
Headstrong, violent ! No use of the mind God gave you.

564
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,000
You talk of God ?

565
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:46,100
You also think it impossible that we, too, might think of God ?

566
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:56,100
You,  who wear the uniform of your country. You see, I wear the uniform of my country.

567
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:03,200
Yes, we've had to use drastic means to get to you, but you left us no alternative.

568
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:10,800
When you have the solaronite, you have nothing. Nor, does the universe.

569
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:16,100
You speak of solaronite, but just what is it ?

570
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Take a can of your gasoline. Say this can of gasoline is the sun.

571
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:29,200
Now you spread a thin a line of it to a ball, representing the Earth.

572
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:35,200
Now, the gasoline represents the sunlight, the sun particles.

573
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:40,300
Here we saturate the ball with the gasoline, the sunlight.

574
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,600
Then we put a flame to the ball. The flame will speedily travel around the Earth,

575
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:49,100
back along the line of gasoline to can,

576
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:57,200
or the sun itself. It will explode this source, and spread to every place that gasoline, or sunlight, touches.

577
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:04,200
Explode the sunlight here, Gentlemen, and you explode the universe.

578
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:11,900
Explode the sunlight here, and a chain reaction will occur, direct to the sun itself.

579
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:16,100
And to all the planets that sunlight touches.

580
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:21,200
To every planet in the universe. This why you must be stopped.

581
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,600
This is why any means must be used to stop you.

582
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:31,900
In a friendly manner, or as it seems, you want it.

583
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,000
-He's mad.
-Mad ? Is it mad that you destroy other people to save yourselves ?

584
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,300
You have done this.

585
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:44,300
Is it mad that one country must destroy another to save themselves ?

586
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:48,400
You have also done this. How then is it mad that one planet

587
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:52,700
must destroy another that threatens the very existence-
-That's enough !!

588
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:59,100
In my land, women are for advancing the race, not for fighting

589
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:04,400
man's battles. Life is not so expansive on my planet.

590
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:10,200
We don't cling to it like you do. Our entire aim is for the development of our planet.

591
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,700
-What happened to you ?
-How come you're all alone ?

592
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,700
I asked for lots of help !
-You sounded drunk or something on the radio.

593
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,800
-If I didn't see it with my own eyes I would never have believed it !
-Believed what ?

594
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:42,200
It was horrible ! And he almost broke my shoulder !

595
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:47,300
Look, what are you trying to say ? If you don't make sense we'll never get to the bottom of this. Now who slugged you ?

596
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,700
Inspector Clay.

597
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,800
-What ?
-It was Clay all right, only not like we remembered him.

598
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:57,800
Well his grave was busted into, wasn't it ?

599
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:00,000
Next you'll tell me you saw skeletons.

600
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:04,100
-We did, earlier.
-Now I know you're off your rocker.

601
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,500
All of us saw, the Lieutenant, the Colonel, everybody!

602
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,300
-Where's the Lieutenant now ?
-We've gotta find them.

603
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:16,000
Mrs. Trent is gone! I was left here to guard her. Then Clay showed up and put me out of the running.

604
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:18,900
And the second time tonight and I'm getting darned tired of it !

605
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,300
-Which way were they going ?
-Oh, that way.

606
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,400
Come on !

607
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:34,500
Then one day it could all be gone, in one big puff of smoke

608
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:38,700
and ball of fire. All that out there,

609
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,900
the stars, the planets,

610
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
all just an empty void.

611
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,700
You two had better come along with us.

612
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,800
-Come with you ? Where ?
-The police station.

613
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:59,300
So it seems you think you have the upper hand.

614
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,600
Look out there.

615
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:07,700
Jeff.

616
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,400
She is unharmed, but he would kill in seconds if I so choose.

617
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,400
Holy cow!

618
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,500
Look there.

619
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:50,900
It's Clay all right, there's no mistaking that.
-And he's got Mrs. Trent !

620
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,600
-Get your gun ready.
-From all I've seen tonight guns won't do any good.

621
01:12:55,700 --> 01:13:00,000
Clay is dead, and we buried him. How are we going to kill somebody that's already dead ?

622
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:05,700
Dead ! And yet there he stands ! That other one earlier I emptied a full clip into him.

623
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,800
I'm seeing it, that's the only reason I'm listening to you.

624
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:17,100
Look, I've got an idea. Hurt him or not, we've got to try something.

625
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:21,500
I'm going to sneak up behind him and whop him over the head. That oughta make him move.

626
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,900
Follow me. Even when Clay was alive he couldn't run fast enough to catch me,

627
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:30,200
so when he does, you grab Mrs. Trent and run like lightning in the opposite direction.

628
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:33,700
-Oh, you think it will work ?
-Know anything else to try ?

629
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:55,800
Oh, I'll be all right. Take care of the others.

630
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:00,800
Your men have felled the big one.

631
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:04,500
This could only happen because the electrode ray is off.

632
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,500
He'll walk again when I turn it on.

633
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,200
Hold it, right there.

634
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:13,300
-Suppose the Lieutenant and the others are in that thing !
-Well suppose there are martians or something in there !

635
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:23,700
Come on, let's go.

636
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,300
Open up in there, open up !

637
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:36,200
-Get that door open.
-Colonel I wouldn't know one switch from another.

638
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,400
Hold on Eros, I'll have the ship in the air in a minute !

639
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,300
Get out of here, Jeff ! The ship's on fire !

640
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,500
Eros !

641
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:45,600
Eros everything's on fire ! Hurry, wake up Eros ! Eros, Eros, wake up, wake up !

642
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:56,700
Eros! Eros wake up, Eros! God wake up!

643
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Oh, I wonder if that's the last we'll see of them ?

644
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:20,900
Perhaps, but sooner or later there'll be other.

645
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Look !

646
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:30,700
Have they caught that woman, that thing yet ?

647
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,200
Hey that's right, there's another ghoul running loose.

648
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:35,600
And it's my guess that she'll look like him.

649
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:39,700
With the ship and the ray gun gone, they have no control.

650
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:44,600
We got to hand it to them though, they're far ahead from us.

651
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:53,200
Fire ! Eros ! Aaaaaaaaah !

652
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:05,200
My friend, you have seen this incident based on sworn testimony.

653
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:09,200
Can you prove that it didn't happen ?

654
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:13,300
Perhaps on your way home, you will pass someone in the dark,

655
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:17,500
and you will never know it, for they will be from outer space.

656
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:23,200
Many scientists believe that another world is watching us this moment.

657
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:26,700
We once laughed at the horseless carriage,

658
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,800
the aeroplane, the telephone, the electric light, vitamins,

659
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,400
radio, and even television !

660
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:38,500
And now some of us laugh at outer space.

661
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:46,400
God help us... in the future.
